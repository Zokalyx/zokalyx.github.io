<Paragraph>
	I grew up with computers and really learned their ins and outs. For example, video games have
	indirectly taught me a lot about computer hardware. I've needed office programs like PowerPoint,
	Word, and Excel for my school assignments, and my artistic endeavors have led me to learn audio,
	image, and video editing. Still, there's always more to learn and improve.

	A big "side passion" of mine is math and physics. I've studied those subjects as an Engineering
	major, but only when they're directly applicable to my area of expertise. Over the years, I've
	studied a few other subjects on my own, and I plan to steadily continue that journey. I'm really
	curious about the universe and the fancy mathematical tools some people have come up with to
	understand it.
